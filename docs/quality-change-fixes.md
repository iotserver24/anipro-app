# Video Quality Change Fixes Documentation

## Issue Description
The video player was experiencing issues with quality changes:
1. After changing quality once, the UI would remain stuck in the "changing..." state
2. This prevented users from changing quality again, as the quality buttons remained disabled
3. The quality change process wasn't properly resetting its state after completion

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Delayed State Reset**: The `onLoad` handler was resetting the `isQualityChanging` state after a 500ms delay, which was too long
2. **Lack of Timeout Management**: Timeouts weren't being properly tracked and cleared, leading to race conditions
3. **UI Feedback Issues**: The quality button UI didn't clearly indicate which quality was being changed to

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Immediate State Reset After Loading
Modified the `onLoad` handler in `app/anime/watch/[episodeId].tsx` to reset the quality changing state immediately upon loading the new quality:

```typescript
onLoad: (data: OnLoadData) => {
  setDuration(data.duration);
  setLoading(false);
  
  // Use specialized handler or normal loading logic
  if (isQualityChanging) {
    console.log('[DEBUG] Video loaded during quality change');
    // Reset quality changing state immediately
    setIsQualityChanging(false);
    console.log('[DEBUG] Quality change completed and ready for next change');
  } else {
    // Normal loading behavior
    // ...existing code...
  }
},
```

### 2. Improved Quality Button UI
Updated the quality button rendering to better indicate which quality is being changed to:

```typescript
<View style={styles.qualityOptions}>
  {qualities.map((q) => {
    const isChangingToThisQuality = isQualityChanging && selectedQuality === q.quality;
    return (
      <TouchableOpacity
        key={q.quality}
        style={[
          styles.qualityButton,
          selectedQuality === q.quality && styles.selectedQuality,
          isChangingToThisQuality && styles.qualityChanging
        ]}
        onPress={() => {
          console.log(`Quality button pressed: ${q.quality}`);
          handleQualityChange(q.quality);
        }}
        disabled={isQualityChanging}
      >
        <Text style={styles.qualityText}>
          {q.quality}
          {isChangingToThisQuality && '...'}
        </Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    );
  })}
</View>
```

### 3. Better Timeout Management
Added a timeout reference array to manage timeouts, with a cleanup effect to clear them when the component unmounts:

```typescript
// Add a ref to track timeouts
const timeoutIdsRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout[]>([]);

// Add a cleanup effect for timeouts
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    // Clear all timeouts when component unmounts
    timeoutIdsRef.current.forEach(id => clearTimeout(id));
  };
}, []);

// In handleQualityChange:
const resetTimeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
  if (isQualityChanging) {
    console.log('[DEBUG] Quality change: Timeout reached, resetting quality changing state');
    setIsQualityChanging(false);
  }
}, 5000);

// Store the timeout ID for cleanup
timeoutIdsRef.current.push(resetTimeoutId);
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes
1. When changing quality:
   - The button will show "..." while changing
   - The "..." will disappear immediately once the video loads with the new quality
   - The button will display the selected quality (e.g., "360p") in a highlighted state
   - Users can immediately change quality again after the process completes

2. The quality change process will complete correctly, even in error scenarios:
   - The UI will accurately reflect when a quality change is complete
   - Users can change quality multiple times without issues
   - Timeouts are properly managed to avoid memory leaks

## Debugging Tips
If quality change issues persist:

1. Check the console logs for messages containing:
   - `[DEBUG] Quality change:`
   - `[DEBUG] Video loaded during quality change`

2. Verify that the `isQualityChanging` state is being reset properly:
   - After a successful quality change
   - After a timeout if the quality change fails
   - When the component unmounts

3. Ensure the `VideoPlayer` component is receiving the correct props:
   - `isQualityChanging` should be `true` only during an active quality change
   - `savedQualityPosition` should contain the correct playback position

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `app/anime/watch/[episodeId].tsx`
   - Updated `onLoad` handler to reset quality changing state immediately
   - Improved quality button UI with better state tracking
   - Added timeout management with proper cleanup

### Key State Variables:
- `isQualityChanging`: Tracks whether a quality change is in progress
- `selectedQuality`: Stores the currently selected quality
- `savedPosition`: Stores the playback position before quality change

### Key Functions:
- `handleQualityChange`: Manages the quality change process
- `onLoad`: Handles video loading, including after quality changes
